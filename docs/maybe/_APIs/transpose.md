**maybe&lt;basic_result&lt;_, T, E&gt;&gt;::transpose()**

```cpp
maybe<basic_result<_, T, E>>::transpose() const&
  -> basic_result<_, maybe<T>, E> ;
```

Transposes a `maybe` of a `result` into a `result` of a `maybe`.

`nothing` will be mapped to `success(nothing)`.
`just(success(_))` and `just(failure(_))` will be mapped to `success(just(_))` and `failure(_)`ã€€(_ is a placeholder).

**Example**

```cpp
result<maybe<int>, std::string> x = success(just(5));
maybe<result<int, std::string>> y = just(success(5));
REQUIRE(x == y.transpose());
```
